Hello, my name is De Zhi Shee, currently on my final year studying Cyber Security and Digital Forensic. I'm a tech fanatic and love to discover new technology, it could be hardware or software or both XDDD. I loved to study machines and software at a low level to understand the fundamental workings, actually understanding why and how things work at a low level brings me joy and fulfillment. So I loved reverse engineering and malware analysis, even though i suck at it, i still love to solve challenges and try to learn something new. Malware Analysis is another field i also want to improve in, i hope that i could use my reverse engineering skills to reverse engineer the inner working of a mwalre. Do reach out to me on linkedin or my social media, always glad to connect. ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっ
